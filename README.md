## Introduction 
 A CLI tool that helps you quickly create a pure TypeScript project tailored for use with LangchainJS. This tool sets up a comprehensive development environment, complete with pre-commit hooks, esLint configuration, prettier, commit linting, and more.

Here's what you can expect from create-langchainjs-app:

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: We've got you covered with pre-commit hooks that ensure your code is formatted and linted before you commit.
2. **EsLint configuration**: We set up esLint to enforce coding standards and help you catch errors early.
3. **Prettier**: We've included prettier to keep your code looking neat and organized.
4. **Commit Lint**: Our commit linting feature ensures that your commit messages are clear and consistent.
5. **Git init**: We initialize a new git repository for you, so you can start versioning your code right away.
6. **Install dependencies**: We take care of installing the necessary dependencies for your project, including TypeScript and its related tools.
7. **Gitignore**: We set up a .gitignore file to ignore unnecessary files and help you keep your repository organized.
8. **TypeScript**: We use TypeScript with ES modules (ESM) to enable tree shaking and optimize your code for production.
9. **TypeScript alias using @**: We configure TypeScript to use the @ symbol as an alias for your project's namespace, making it easier to import and use your code.
